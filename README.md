The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a population-based program of studies that uses intricate, multistage sampling to represent the population of all ages among civilian, non-institutionalized Americans. From 30 distinct survey locations, 16,211 participants for the NHANES in 2017â€“2018 were selected. The chosen 9,254 completed the interview and 8,704 carried out testing. Numerous parameters, such as body measurements, blood pressure, cholesterol, and alcohol statistics, have been taken into consideration when examining the risk factors. We analyze the BMI and body weight data because the data have been combined. We are trying to determine if there is a correlation between an individual's characteristics like blood pressure, cholesterol, and alcohol consumption and diabetes.
